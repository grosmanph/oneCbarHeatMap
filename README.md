# oneCbarHeatMap
# Intro
This python code uses pandas and seaborn to create a heatmaps-composed image labelled by a single colour bar.
# You'll need
* matplotlib.pyplot
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
# Data
The data that I selected for this demonstration was obtained from an experiment carried out by myself. On that occasion, we were interested in comparing how two fibre-coupled photon detectors count down-converted photons simultaneously in different cases. 
# Usefullness
What is interesting in this sort of visualization is that you can visualize, at the same time and in the same image, several heatmaps associated to a single colour bar, instead of having one colour bar for each heatmap; which sometimes can be hugely space-consuming. Besides saving space and making your presentation cleaner, you can associate each heatmap, or even a group of them, to a specific case. This makes you able to show and compare results from different cases.
